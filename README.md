# Q-learning-pong

A Python implementation of the classic Pong game with Q-Learning AI, designed for educational and research purposes.

## Features
- **Q-Learning AI**: Implements a reinforcement learning agent to control the paddle.
- **Customizable Game**: Easily adjust game parameters like paddle size, ball speed, and more.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the AI learn and improve in real-time.
- **Performance Analytics**: Track and analyze the AI's learning progress.
- **Modular Design**: Well-structured codebase for easy extension and experimentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KIWI0912/Q-learning-pong.git
   cd Q-learning-pong
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python -m src.game.environment
   ```

## Quick Start

### Training the AI
To train the Q-Learning agent:
```bash
python -m src.agents.q_agent
```

### Playing the Game
To play the game manually:
```bash
python -m src.game.environment --mode=manual
```
